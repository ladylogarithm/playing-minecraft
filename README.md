# Minecraft Survival Journal: PS5 Edition

## About This Repository

This repository is my personal survival journal and project tracker for my Minecraft world on the PS5. I'm using Git and GitHub because I enjoy the workflow and want a structured way to set goals, create checklists, and document my adventures in survival mode.

The main goal is to build a cool base, explore the world, and accomplish some major in-game objectives.

### Current World Goals:
* Establish a primary base near a body of water.
* Find and build a community with a seaside village.
* Explore the ocean and unlock underwater abilities.
* Defeat the Ender Dragon.

This is a living document, and the goals will evolve as I play! :)
